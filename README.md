This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

file from google drive: 
To display an image stored on Google Drive in your Markdown file, you'll need to convert the standard sharing URL into a direct image link that Markdown can render. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Make Your Image Publicly Accessible

* Upload your image to Google Drive.
* Right-click the image and choose **"Share"**.
* Under "General access," set the image so that anyone with the link can view it.

### 2. Get the File ID

Google Drive sharing links typically look like this:

```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing
```

Here, **FILE\_ID** is the unique identifier for your image. Copy this ID.

### 3. Construct the Direct Link

Replace the original URL with the following format:

```
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID
```

For example, if your file ID is `1A2B3C4D5E6F`, the direct link becomes:

```
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1A2B3C4D5E6F
```

### 4. Embed the Image in Markdown

Use the standard Markdown image syntax with the new URL:

```markdown
![Alternative Text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID "Optional Title")
```

Replace `FILE_ID` with your actual file ID. For example:

```markdown
![My Image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1A2B3C4D5E6F "My Image Title")
```

### Important Considerations

* **Privacy Settings:** Ensure your image file's sharing settings allow public access, or the image will not load.
* **Link Expiration:** Google Drive links might change if you update the file or its sharing settings, so verify the link if it stops working.
* **Markdown Renderer:** Your Markdown renderer (GitHub, VS Code, etc.) must support loading external images for this method to work.

Using these steps, you should be able to display an image from Google Drive in your Markdown file successfully. Let me know if you need further clarification!



First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
